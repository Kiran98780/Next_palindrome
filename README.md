Next_Palindrome computation
```
This project finds the next palindrome number for a given input number.\
There are 2 methods described in the project.\
Next_Palindrome.java - This file implements the main driver method allowing the user to select a choice of the method to use.\
Next_Palindrome_Method1.java - This file implements method 1 is a naive method where the count of the number is incremented by 1 to compute the palindrome. The complexity is O(N).\
Next_Palindrome_Method2.java - This file implements method 2 has a log N complexity and considers 6 different cases for even and odd numbers.\
The maximum number of digits that can have the next palindrome computed is 10.\
In order to run the project, download the source code and open either using IntelliJ Idea IDE or terminal. Then build and run the code.\
